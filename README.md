# Summation Notation Calculator

## Overview

A simple calculator for evaluating summation notation expressions. The calculator supports various scenarios, including summation of series, linear combinations, sequences of terms, and constants.

## Examples

1. Summation of 2 or more variables (summation of a series, linear combination)

$$\sum_{i=1}^{n} xi+yi+zi$$

$$\sum_{i=1}^{4} 4i+5i+8i$$

```input
Enter how many variables: 3
Enter a variable: 4
Enter a variable: 5
Enter a variable: 8
Enter your starting point: 1
Enter your stopping point: 4
```

```output
Result: 170.0
```

2. Summation of 2 or more variables (summation of sequence of terms)

$$\sum_{i=1}^{n} x+y+z$$

$$\sum_{i=1}^{4} 3+5+7$$

```input
Enter how many variables: 3
Enter a variable: 3
Enter a variable: 5
Enter a variable: 7
Enter your starting point: 1
Enter your stopping point: 4
```

```output
Result: 15.0
```

3. Summation of a constant v1

$$\sum_{i=1}^{n} cx = c \sum_{i=1}^{n} xi$$

$$\sum_{i=1}^{n} 8x = 8 \sum_{i=1}^{4} xi$$

```input
Enter your constant: 8
Enter your starting point: 1
Enter your stopping point: 4
```

```output
Result: 80.0
```

4. Summation of a constant v2

$$\sum_{i=1}^{n} c = \sum_{i=1}^{n} nc$$

$$\sum_{i=1}^{4} 8 = \sum_{i=1}^{4} 8n$$

```input
Enter your constant: 8
Enter your starting point: 1
Enter your stopping point: 4
```

```output
Result: 32.0
```
